## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- I repeated the logic of the css flex structure. In this way, I re-examined this issue that I had forgotten.
- The feature that combines justify-content and align-items features (used with flex-layout)

```css
body {
  place-content: center;
}
```
